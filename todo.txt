MAJOR:
Revise C++ files to eliminate passing functions through multiple nested objects,
and return pointers instead. getContacts(), getPerceptions(), and so on should
return a pointer to an object on the heap.




FEATURES:
bragging system:
    Currently transmissions with bragged data has no effect on perception.
    
popularity/celebrity:
    Sb's with extremely high/low traits should have increased popularity, and should
    be discussed more often by others. Other factors should come into play with 
    celebrities.
    
private sessions:
    Sb initiating a session should determine what that session's max capacity
    should be. Only highest-rated others should be invited to private sessions.
    
arguments/agreements:
    Intellectual conversations should affect perceptions.
    
perception affects:
    Mechanics should be built to allow perceptions to be adjusted outside of 
    analyzing perceived traits. Invitations, rejections, arguments, extreme levels
    in session, and other events should modify perceptions.
    
perception changes:
    Perceived traits should be made into averageContainer objects.
    
relationships:
    Add more tiers to relationships other than friends. Acquaintences, best
    friends, etc.
    
change sb cycles so entire cycle takes place in sb wrapper, not in session cycle

revise bond system, make sure bonds increment every cycle, not just alone cycles
